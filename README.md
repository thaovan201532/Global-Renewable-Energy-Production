# Global Renewable Energy Production


Dashboard information

This dataset contains annual data on renewable energy production from various countries, spanning from 2000 to 2023. 

It includes information on energy generation from solar, wind, hydro, and other renewable sources. 

The dataset aims to provide insights into the growth and distribution of renewable energy production worldwide.

Columns:

Year: The year of data collection (e.g., 2000, 2001, etc.).

Country: The name of the country.

SolarEnergy: Annual solar energy production in gigawatt-hours (GWh).

WindEnergy: Annual wind energy production in gigawatt-hours (GWh).

HydroEnergy: Annual hydro energy production in gigawatt-hours (GWh).

OtherRenewableEnergy: Annual energy production from other renewable sources (e.g., geothermal, biomass) in gigawatt-hours (GWh).

TotalRenewableEnergy: Total annual renewable energy production in gigawatt-hours (GWh).

This dashboard helps make strategic decisions about types of energy through data processed by calculation formulas.

Looking at the table, we can see how energy sources are used across countries and years.

Hydrogen Energy is the most used, with 39.16% 

Second is Wind Energy, with 31.18% 

Third is Solar Energy, with 19.22%

Along with data on countries using the most types of energy, to the least, arranged in order.
